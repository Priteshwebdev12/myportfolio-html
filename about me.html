    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <P>
        Hey there! I’m a passionate Web Developer on a mission to turn ideas into beautifully crafted digital experiences.<br/>
        With 2 years of professional experience outside the tech world, I've built a strong foundation in problem-solving,<br/> communication, and teamwork — skills that now fuel my journey into Front-End and Back-End development.<br/>
        
        Currently, I’m sharpening my skills in:<br/>
        
        ✨ Front-End:<br/>
        HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Responsive Design, Bootstrap<br/>
        
        🛠️ Back-End:<br/>
        Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, REST APIs, SQL (Basics)<br/>
        
        Every day, I'm learning, building, and pushing myself to create websites and applications that don't just look good — they work beautifully too.<br/>
        I'm excited about crafting seamless, user-first experiences and always hungry to explore the next big thing in tech!<br/>
        
        Let’s build something awesome together. 🚀</P>
